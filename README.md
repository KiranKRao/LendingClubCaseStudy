**Problem Statement**

**High Default Rates:** among borrowers labeled as 'charged-off' result in significant financial losses for lenders. It is crucial to understand the characteristics and behaviors that indicate a higher likelihood of default.

**Inefficient Loan Approval Processes:** The current lending practices may not adequately consider the risk factors associated with borrowers, leading to misguided approvals and increased exposure to defaults. 

**Lack of Data-Driven Insights:** Without thorough data analysis, it is challenging to establish effective criteria for evaluating borrower risk. This lack of insight hampers the company's ability to optimize its loan offerings and customer segmentation.

**Impact on Profitability:** Credit losses directly impact the bottom line. Reducing the number of high-risk loans can enhance overall profitability and sustainability for the business.

**Project Objective:** The project aims to enhance risk assessment strategies, reduce credit loss, and ultimately improve the company's financial performance and customer experience.
